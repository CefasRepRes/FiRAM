#' Fisheries Resource Allocation Model
#'
#' @description The `FishRAM` package implements the dynamic system model from Tidbury et. al. (2021) which simulates the biological and economic impacts for recreational and commercial fishing under different stock allocation scenarios. Default values are set to represent the biology of Sea bass \emph{Dicentrarchus labrax} in division  27-4.bâ€“c (North Atlantic stock) and English inshore commercial fishing fleet and recreational anglers.
#'
#' @details
#' Running simulations in `FishRAM` is done in 3 main stages:
#' 1. Set up model parameters using the `BioeconomicParams` constructor function.
#' 2. Run simulations using the `project` function and a recruitment scenario. This creates a `BioeconomicSim` object.
#' 3. Explore results by calling plotting functions (`plot, plotStock, plotActivity, plotEconomicImpact`) on the `BioeconomicSim` object.
